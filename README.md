# programming_practice
This is a repository for all my experience with anything minutely related to competitive or algorithmic programming. Heavily inspired by this [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prepare-for-acm-icpc) page.

Head to this [google doc] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TtJn_YQ_73irZ7_6j_GvN5Csf96IoMa1dPo_lb4eGd0/edit#gid=1160016643) for my times for the codeforces problems.
